## Sander van Gestel
My name is Sander and I am currently a second year master student in the program Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioral, Biomedical and Social Sciences at Utrecht University. I am writing my master thesis about the joint model. More specifically, I am investigating whether the joint model is more appropriate for analyzing longitudinal data obtained in ALS-studies than the linear mixed model. I really like my thesis topic because I can use statistics to the benefit of, something that I think is everything, health. I hope to contribute to the field of medical statistics.
